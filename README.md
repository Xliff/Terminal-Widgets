NAME

Terminal::Widgets - Basic TUI Widgets

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
# See examples/ directory!
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Terminal::Widgets is in a very, *very* early state, pretty much the minimum for which I could write a not-completely-embarassing proof-of-concept working script in examples/ and on which I could start to port some of my old bespoke TUI scripts.

It is **CERTAIN** that many things will be changing in the near future, although finally a few things seem like they aren't terrible and might stick around for a while.

**This is not version `0.0.x` because I'm modest, it's because it really is that early!**

Not completely scared off yet? Come visit `#mugs` on `libera.chat` IRC and feel free to ask questions or offer ideas.
