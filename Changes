Revision history for Terminal-Widgets

{{$NEXT}}

0.1.3  2024-02-22T23:38:50-08:00
  [Debugging]
  - Add tunable Widget compositing debugging
  - Make ACTIVE state more obvious in Input.gist-flags

  [Functionality]
  - Add support for menu item icons


0.1.2  2024-02-21T20:44:08-08:00
  [Bug fixes]
  - Update META6 to require latest versions of dependencies, and add a missing
    dependency (Text::MiscUtils)


0.1.1  2024-02-21T18:35:46-08:00
  [API Changes]
  - First *experimental* version of translatable UI elements; see Functionality
  - This release should still be compatible with existing 0.1.0 code, but
    future releases in the 0.1.x cycle may not be
  - Will almost certainly require some additional changes to work seamlessly
    with span tree coloring and proper interpolations

  [Bug Fixes]
  - Fit styles example into 80 columns (it was not intended to demonstrate
    overflow behavior and doesn't handle it well)

  [Functionality]
  - Translatable string markup operators added for lightweight code changes
  - Translations handled by Locale object, which is tied to the Terminal
  - Terminal passed as context to Layout objects, allowing the Locale
    to influence layout measurements
  - Terminal capabilities and locale can now be updated on the fly (causing
    a screen refresh)
  - Currently works with Labeled Input, Menu, and PlainText widgets
  - PlainText widgets can optionally add soft-wrapping behavior in addition
    to respecting hard-wrapped lines in the input text as before
  - Window title also translated (and sanitized for security reasons)

  [Refactoring]
  - Refactor debug-grid and improve its empty grid handling


0.1.0  2024-02-12T17:19:15-08:00
  [API Changes]
  - Begin process of rationalizing refresh handling for an easier mental model
    and fewer redundant or missing refreshes
  - Create a new global LayoutBuilt event, and issue it in TopLevel.relayout
    to notify widgets that the overall layout has finished building (and thus
    all widgets should now exist and be nominally initialized)

  [Functionality]
  - Add initial support for styling of span trees
  - Add styled span tree support to Viewer::Log

  [Examples]
  - Demo span-styled log entries and layout gists in form example

  [Refactoring]
  - Massive refactor of Viewer::Log to use LogEntry objects


0.0.13  2024-02-12T16:54:00-08:00
  [Bug Fixes]
  - Fix precedence thinko in menu width detection that caused some menus to
    overdraw their right boundary
  - Invalidate grid-string cache for full-screen composites, fixing a visual
    bug seen when switching back to a previously-viewed screen
  - Compute fixed layouts for widgets created statically from an existing grid
  - Add stub for build-layout method to clarify that TopLevel requires it

  [Debugging]
  - Show when a Widget is focused in Widget gists
  - Add a debug-grid method to Widget for dumping a widget's grid contents
    as an ANSI-colored snapshot, rather than as an array of arrays of Cells


0.0.12  2023-11-26T21:03:49-08:00
  [Bug Fixes]
  - Select correct item when using mouse-click selection on a scrolled Menu
  - Allow Text input to receive focus via mouse click
  - Make sure TopLevel's .layout object knows its own .widget object (the
    original TopLevel itself)
  - Build *base* Widget objects as internal widget tree nodes if requested
    by the layout tree
  - Draw framing on *base* Widget objects also, not just subclasses
  - Make sure Style.clone calls Style's TWEAK, just as for new/bless
  - Sort unset layout children by MarginBox size, not default sizing box
  - Simplify and fix propagate-xy box model corrections
  - Fix correction handling in child layout share computations

  [Examples]
  - Update styles example to include box model (framing) styling as well

  [Refactoring]
  - Factor color-merge() helper out to ::Utils::Color
  - Refactor, improve, and expand gist logic for both Widget and Layout objects
  - Clarify layout computation via change of variable


0.0.11  2023-11-12T17:11:18-08:00
  [Bug Fixes]
  - Prefer to autofocus on widgets that process input (falling back to widgets
    that are able to handle events of any type, as before)

  [Examples]
  - Add an example showing how to move back and forth between form pages


0.0.10  2023-11-12T14:53:56-08:00
  [Bug Fixes]
  - Fix layout bug causing max limits to be ignored when allocating extra space
    to undersized child layout nodes

  [Examples]
  - Add a scrolling, colored, responsive-layout menu example

  [Functionality]
  - Support autoscrolling Menu input widgets

0.0.9  2023-11-08T15:34:35-08:00
  [Bug Fixes]

  - Add a custom gist method for Menu


0.0.8  2023-09-03T20:24:54-07:00
  [Bug Fixes]
  - Minor tweaks, fixes, and error message improvements

  - Stub in ::I18N::Locale class and ensure each Terminal gets one

  [Performance]
  - Various minor micro-optimizations

  [Quality]
  - Improve quality and performance of gray-color() utility multis
  - Better represent uneven xterm-256 color cube mapping in rgb-color() utility
    multis, adding rgb-color-flat() multis to use the old flat-mapping formulae

  [Refactoring]
  - Move all color utilities in ::Utils into a separate ::Utils::Color module
  - Move relayout phases from Terminal to TopLevel
  - Move TW_* environment var handling to ::App.add-terminal
  - Significantly refactor and simplify App booting (many commits), resulting
    in adding separate ::Simple::App class as well
